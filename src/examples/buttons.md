metaDescription: Buttons are the most important way to interaction between your users and your app or product.
title: Buttons
description: Buttons are the main currency on the web and as such is important to get them right. At their simplest level they can be clicked to carry out actions on behalf of the user. The first point is to ensure that the button description, in the form of the text on it, reflects the action that the user can expect to occur once clicked.
testimonial: Making sure that you get buttons right is the single most important aspect of effectively reaching out to your users, and hearing what they want back.

### The lowdown

[Buttons](http://Buttons/) are a way to present your users with choices and then have your app, product or site respond apprpriately to that choice. Buttons traditionally have an action written on them, and this gives the user confidence in what they should expect to happen when they click on it.

### The common problems

Buttons should look like buttons - we use switches and buttons without much prompting in the real-world and breaking that paradigm online is an all too common occurence. The reasons for this can be attributed, in reverse order of importance, to ineffective design of the button, poor accompanying labels, and a failure to plan what you want a user to achieve when they do click.

### Ineffective button design

- insufficient sizing through failure to understand common human design interface rules - e.g. a button should be a minimum of 44 points in vertical height, with somewhere around the 50 point mark being most comfortable for users on smaller screens
- unenticing colours have the understandable effect of turning users off - e.g. the [brown Zune music player](https://www.geekwire.com/2011/fond-memories-microsoft-zune-brown/) failed to displace the iPod
- making buttons hard to discern or non-standard shapes and sizes is almost guaranteed to ensure that users miss them - [Google's recent 'birthday' discounts](see screenshot and host on cloudinary?) had to mention which bits to click to find the discount vouchers on their bespoke site.

## Poor labelling

- If you want the user to click then let them know clearly and consisely what they can expect to happen

## Having a plan for the user to follow

Makig sure that the user isn't overloaded with extraeous steps along the process that the button(s) lead them.

It is always challenging when dealing with data driven app with such small screen real estate. Once again, I strive for minimalistic and simplicity.

### The Result

My design was not accepted. I am not sure what is the reason, however, this is a special project, because I almost landed a permanent job. After meeting the founder and get to know the office culture, I am excited to have the opportunity to work with such a passionate and energized team.

However, things didn’t turn out as expected. I have to move to Singapore in order to pursue the position and that’s not a good timing as my wife had just giving birth to our first baby boy few months ago. I have chosen my family this time.

After all, this is quite an exciting project as I have the opportunity to work for a promising startup and learn quite a few non-technical things along the journey.
