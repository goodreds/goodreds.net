## History

I have over two decades experience designing and building for the web, and graduated in IT from RMIT. I've worked on everything from small businesses, charities, entertainment and music sites to medical, public health and government projects. With a broad knowledge of how to help clients get their best possible results, I feel well placed to offer the best of my experience and advice to help you too.

Historically my experience was formed via vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript and a decent chunk of time buidling, deploying and maintaining Wordpress sites.

## Future

My particular areas of interest currently include the JAMStack and design processes, particularly design systems.

My latest project, **re:designsystems**, is intended to provide an expert analysis of client's sites with reports suggesting where to make the 'easy-wins' by improving what you already have.
